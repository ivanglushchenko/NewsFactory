NewsFactory
===========

I have a feeling I owe you an explanation why I decided to create yet another news aggregator. Let's start with a simple one:

1) Because I can!

Yea, I know, not the best explanation possible, but still a valid one. And one which is important to me - I like reminding myself from time to time that I could write stuff for myself if I wanted to. Or if I had more time...

2) Because it's fun!

It really is, sometimes. In this particular case I wanted to play with Windows Store applications in particular and WinRT platform in general. I can't say I am very impressed by it, but let's hope the 3rd version will resolve all the questions I had.

3) Becasue Opera sucks!

Here I need to provide an explanation for an explanation I guess. For many years I've been using Opera web browser. Not becasue it was a good browser (it wasn't) or very fast one (it was, actually). The feature I used the most was rss feeds syndycator - it was very simple and yet powerfull enough so that I could skim over thoughands of news items a day. And then one day Opera changed its UI - and it became clunky. Unfriendly. Almost unusable - or at least not compatible anymore with the way I prefered browsing the news. I tried using existing news readers - but they didn't seem much better. So I decided to write my own reader which will fit perfectly my reading style.
